							<h3>About Dr. Vranjes Firenze</h3><br />
							<p>
								Dr. Vranjes Firenze is the story of a “Nose” in a unique city of art. The “Nose”discovered the scent of the essential elements needed to give life to a product that can reach the heart through the sense of smell.  The “Nose” belongs to Dr. Paolo Vranjes - pharmacist, chemist, and cosmetologist, but, above all, the translator of emotions into olfactory delights.
								The city of art could be no other than Florence, with its elegant, old shops that artfully tempt all five senses.</p>
								<h5>The Florentine tradition</h5>
								<p>
									Florence has a unique tradition in the distillation of essences and perfumes, due in part to the contribution of the elegant Catherine de Medici, the wife of the French King and ambassadress of the art of making perfumes. It was usual for Catherine to hold a scented pomegranate to her nose, and this went on to be known as a pomander, a precious sphere within which were enclosed fragrant herbs and scented ointments. The purpose of the pomander was to make social encounters more pleasant.
								</p>
								<img src="/assets/img/hstownorig.jpg" />

								<h5>The History of Dr. Vranjes</h5><br />
								<p>
									Dr Paolo Vranjes was inspired by his grandfather, who was a silk trader, with a passion for collecting rare and valuable essences and perfumes encountered on his numerous travels. Having become an artisan perfumer, Dr. Paolo Vranjes has developed a range of products in his Florence based laboratory using techniques handed down from generation to generation.  

									Inspired by the scents of the ancient rare essences, he has blended together pure natural ingredients with the world’s finest essential oils to create beautiful fragrances that stimulate body and soul while refreshing and purifying living space.

									Each product is a perfect combination of innovative technology, experience, tradition, and tireless research sparked by a genuine passion for the art of fragrance. 

									Today Dr. Paolo Vranjes is recognised worldwide as one of the premier producers of home fragrances. His brand symbolises quality and luxury and is the finest interior fragrances range available in Europe and the Middle East.

									<h3>About Scent Hill</h3><br />
									<p>Our family has had a long-standing passion for Italy. It's rich history and culture, striking landscapes, fantastic cuisine, wealth of art and music, outstanding artisan produce and, certainly, our wonderful Italian friends make us return to this country every year. Luckily, there is no argument on where we are going on our next holiday!<br /><br />

									It all started in summer of 2013 when we were invited to Tuscany to attend a wedding celebration at a gorgeous ancient villa on the beautiful hills of Florence. Discovering and exploring Tuscany, in general, and, Florence, in particular, was an unforgettably precious experience. That was the first time that we came across the idea of the Art of Scented Decor as we noticed that many venues in Florence were artfully and delicately perfumed.<br /><br />

									In 2014, while going out with our friends, we realized that the smell around the place was divine. It was intriguing and tranquillizing; the type of aroma that evokes lovely feelings and embraces with positive emotions, and makes you wish for these pleasant sensations to last. In addition, that delicate scent was coming from elegant diffusers that were refined pieces of interior decor by themselves. We couldn’t do anything but fell in love with them!<br /><br />

									Having made inquiries about the brand with the help of our wonderful friends, we were back to Florence to visit the laboratories of Dr. Vranjes Firenze and meet the owner and the Nose of the company, Dr. Paolo Vranjes, and his amazingly professional team.  And here we are - the exclusive distributor of Dr. Vranjes Firenze in Egypt. We are happy to share our passion and enthusiasm for scented décor through fantastic house fragrances, scented candles, perfumes and other luxury products.  <br /><br />

									There’s no other brand quite like Dr. Vranjes Firenze and we are very proud to finally have this piece of Italian luxury in Egypt. Let us guide you through and advise you on the unique and refined collection of house fragrances, perfumes, very special gifts and other luxury products created for you by Dr. Paolo Vranjes from the very heart of Tuscany.

								<h3>How to Use Dr. Vranjes Diffusers</h3><br />
								<p>A set of reeds comes with each bottle.</p><br />
								<p>
									<span>To use:</span>  Gently remove the cork, place all the reeds into the bottle and allow them to absorb the fragrance. After, approximately, 30 minutes, reverse all the reeds to experience the subtle release of the perfume. Afterwards, turn all or a few reeds daily to allow the fragrance to be continuously released. You may wish to turn only one reed a day or all of them every other day. It depends on the intensity of the scent that you wish to have.
								</p><br />

								<span>Caution:</span>
								<ul class="circle">
									<li>Dr. Vranjes fragrance oil is flammable.</li>
									<li>Please keep away from children, heat or flames.</li>
									<li>For external use only.</li>
									<li>Avoid contact with eyes.</li>
									<li>If spilt, wipe immediately as it could cause damage to polished surfaces.</li>

								<h3>FAQs</h3><br />
								<ul class="accordion" data-accordion>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel1a">Where is the best place to put my fragrance diffuser?</a>
										<div id="panel1a" class="content">
											<p>
												Ideally your diffuser should be put in a central part of your house, like a hallway, so that as doors open and people walk in and out they waft the fragrance with them. Depending on the size of your house, over time you will find that you can even smell the fragrance upstairs and in farthest areas of your home from where the diffuser is placed. If you have several fragrances, then pick the room that suits the fragrance best.<br /><br />
												Avoid placing the fragrance in direct sunlight, by radiators, heaters or in direct vicinity of ACs as this will affect the diffusion. Also, avoid shelves and corners of rooms furthest from the door, where the fragrance will become trapped and the diffusion become limited.<br /><br />
												There are fragrances to choose from not only for different living areas of your home, but also for your office, boardroom, meeting rooms, client WC, reception and lobby areas.
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel2a">How often should I turn the reeds?</a>
										<div id="panel2a" class="content">
											<p>
												This is largely down to personal preference and position. Put all the supplied reeds in the bottle for approx. 30 minutes to an hour and then turn them all over the first time. After this it is recommended that you turn one or more sticks a day or every other day depending on how strong you want the fragrance. 
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel3a">How long will they last?</a>
										<div id="panel3a" class="content">
											<p>
												As a rule they should last up to 4-6 months for a 500ml bottle, 2-3 months for a 250ml bottle and 3-4 weeks for a 100ml bottle. The duration of time a fragrance lasts depends on its environment: heating, AC, and direct sun light can create evaporation instead of diffusion, using up the liquid more quickly.<br /><br />
												A secret of making your fragrance to last longer is to refill the bottle when it is half-full as diffusion process is slower when the amount of fragrance is more than half.
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel4a">What happens if I spill my fragrance?</a>
										<div id="panel4a" class="content">
											<p>
												If it is on a painted or polished surface you need to wipe it off as quickly as possible. The fragrance is made up from essential oils, water and alcohol, if left, it will mark your furniture. If you get it on your skin or clothes it should be washed off, although you may enjoy smelling very fragrant for a while!
												<br /><br />
												The fragrance is flammable. The reeds are to be used only in the fragrance and can not be lit up!
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel5a">Can I re-use my reeds?</a>
										<div id="panel5a" class="content">
											<p>
												Yes, if you are buying a refill bottle of the same fragrance. Some customers substitute a few of the old reeds with new ones as they will be full of the fragrance even if they have dried out. You will always get a new set of reeds when you buy a new bottle or a refill.
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel6a">What can I do with my reeds after they have dried out?</a>
										<div id="panel6a" class="content">
											<p>
												When the fragrance has totally diffused the reeds will eventually dry out, however they are so impregnated with the scent that they can be used in your drawers, airing cupboards, linen baskets and even in the car! They will keep the fragrance for months to come.
											</p>
										</div>
									</li>
									<li class="accordion-navigation">
										<a href="#panel7a">Why do some of the fragrances get darker and cloudy with time?</a>
										<div id="panel7a" class="content">
											<p>
												Some essential oils have a greater density than others or may react when exposed to light. In cold conditions, denser essential oils can become cloudy (in a similar way to olive oil stored below normal room temperature) and some oils, e.g. vanilla, may darken in bright light. Placing a cloudy diffuser in a warmer room should make it go clear again. Changes in colour or texture do not affect the fragrance of the diffuser.
